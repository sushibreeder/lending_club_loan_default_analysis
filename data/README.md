# Lending Club Data

The full dataset is too large to be uploaded directly to GitHub.

You can download the original dataset from the following Google Drive link:

[Download Lending Club Loan Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TIxvhfJZkCVEfKSPaRBPTTQeCqVZgdpm/view)

Once downloaded, place it in a local `data/` directory when running the analysis script.
